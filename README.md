We're going to build a survey application that lets users create their own multiple-choice polls and other users to vote in them.

This is going to use a combination of pure JavaScript and AJAX to achieve the desired effects.

A survey will have many questions. Each question will have many possible responses. A voter will select one (and only one) response for each question in a survey.

Objectives
Models
	Go back to the polling schema challenges. This schema will be fairly complex and it will help to think in terms of survey-creators versus survey-voters.

	There should be at least 6 core models/tables. You'll need a table to hold rows that represent the following sort of facts:

	1. User A exists
	2. User A created Survey X
	3. Question Y belongs to Survey X
	4. Possible Choice Z belongs to Question Y
	5. User B completed Survey X
	6. User B chose Possible Choice Z for Question Y
	Each of these should correspond to a single table in your database and a single model in your app.

	Users need to be signed in to create a survey and vote in a survey.

Wireframes
	Work through wireframes and discuss what your core pages are and what your core user flows are. There should be two core flows: survey creation and survey completion.

	One possible division of labor would be to separate these two flows.

Survey Creation
	Users will want to create their surveys in "one go" by adding multiple questions and choices per question on a single page. This is an opportunity to create some fun dynamic forms. Check these out:

	Google "jquery dynamic form fields" to find more

	To start and for your own sanity, maybe limit each survey to a single question. Create a version with a single question per survey working first and add support for multiple questions later.

	Surveys should also have an optional image associated with them. CarrierWave is your friend; you'll come to love it with time.

Survey Taking
	For now, a user has to answer every question in a survey. You should be able to implement this constraint using a single custom validation on a single model.

Survey Results
	Create a nice page that shows the survey creator the results of a survey. If you want to do something fancy, try using d3.js. This is very advanced.

	There are other charting libraries like Flot or Highcharts.

	At the very least, create some simple HTML bar charts by having percentage-width divs with a fixed height and solid background color so that we can see how people responded for each question in a particular survey.

Advanced Features
	If you're looking for more advanced features, how about something that lets a user view a survey without logging in but pops up a modal dialog to prompt a user to sign in/sign up right before they vote?

	How about more advanced visualizations, like time series?
	How about focusing on making the user interface really nice?
	How about multiple question types?
